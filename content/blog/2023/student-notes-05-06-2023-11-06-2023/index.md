## Introducción

Hola a todos y bienvenidos a los *Student Notes*, espacio donde resumo los diferentes recursos, temas, herramientas que he aprendido durante la semana. Esto forma parte de una técnica de estudio para consolidar el aprendizaje a través de explicarlos y compartirlos. Es importante enfatizar que las notas son una breve explicación acerca de lo que aprendí acerca de la materia en específico, para profundizar en los temas te compartiré links a las fuentes de cada una de ellas.

Espero que les sea útil igual que a mi.

## How to request and interrupt in a polite way?

Ok ok. Welcome to the English section :D. This week was interesting because I could learn how to make request and most important how to interrupt politely. I use to think I sound a bit rude when I was trying to jump into a conversation. So would you like to know how to do those things? Let's start.

### Politely Interrupting 

As always an important factor is the context. There are some expressions that are going to be appropiate in a formal context like a debate or a bussiness meetings but there are others that could be used in a friendly discussion with your friends or family.

If you are with your family or your pals you could use the following expressions:

**Can**

* Can I interrupt for a moment?
* Can I add something here?
* Can I stop you there for a moment?

**Would**

* Would you mind if I jumped in here?
* Would it be ok if I added something here?

**Let**

* Let me jump in here, if you don't mind
* Let me add something here ...
* Let me interrupt a moment

**Sorry**

* Sorry for interrupting, but
* I'm sorry to interrupt, but
* Sorry, but may I interrupt for a moment

__Note:__ Remember the positive answer for a "Would you mind if ...?" questions are **No, I don't mind**.

On the other side if you are in a formal context you could use the following expressions:

* Pardon me, ...
* Excuse me, ...
* Before you move on ...

Let share you some examples:

1. Hey Mike can I add something here? I think the best Marvel's movie is Infinity.
2. Would you mind if I jumped in here? We are missing the fact we don't live close Cami's house.
3. Pardon me, sir. I would like you remember we are here to discuss the new marketing plan.
4. Before you move on I'd like to make an important point here.

### Making polite requests

If you want to ask someone to do something for you in a polite way, you could use the following expressions:

* Would you be so kind as to ... ?
* I wonder if you'll be kind enough to ...
* Will you be so very kind as to ... ?
* Would you kindly ...?

__Note:__ Each of these expressions should be followed by a verb in the infinite form. Ex: Would you be so kind as to help me with the dishes?

There is another expressions that follows the format: Polite start request + Request + Polite end request.

* If you'd be so kind as to + [ infinitive verb - request ] + I would appreciate it greatly.
* If you'll be so good as to + [ infinitive verb - request ] + I would be most grateful.
